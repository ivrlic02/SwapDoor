### Project Summary

**Project title:** SwapDoor  
**Problem statement:** Travelling is often expensive and impersonal — hotels cost too much and rarely feel like home.  
**Target users:** Travelers, families, and digital nomads looking for authentic, affordable stays around the world.  
**Proposed solution:** SwapDoor is a platform for home exchange that connects travelers who wish to swap their homes temporarily, allowing them to experience real local living instead of renting traditional accommodation.  
**How we came up with the idea:** We wanted to design a platform that promotes cultural exchange and affordable travel. Inspired by the idea of “sharing, not spending,” SwapDoor was born as a fun and community-driven alternative to hotels and rentals.
