# **Assignment 5 – Next.js - Dynamic routes, data fetching**

## **Assignment Overview**
This assignment focuses on implementing dynamic routes and server-side data fetching in a Next.js application.
The project includes dynamically generated pages for posts(swaps), with data fetched from a custom online JSON file acting as a mock API created via mocki.io platform.
The application is deployed to a public hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify) to demonstrate fully functional dynamic routing in a production environment.
