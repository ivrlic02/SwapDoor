## **Assignment Overview**
In this assignment we designed our the archetypes of our websites 3 most likely users. Furthermore, we also provided a Sitemap and Card sorting for personas which we hope will enable us
easier realization of the project.

## User Personas
In this document we identified and described three distinct user personas that represent the main audience groups for SwapDoor. Each persona includes detailed information such as goals, motivations, challenges, and preferred ways of interacting with the platform. These personas will guide future design and development decisions to make sure the interface feels personal and accessible to every user.

## Information Architecture
The information architecture section outlines how the website’s content is structured and organized to ensure logical navigation and usability. It includes a sitemap and results of card sorting exercises, which helped us understand how users naturally group and access information. This structure aims to make SwapDoor intuitive, reducing friction and helping users achieve their goals efficiently.
